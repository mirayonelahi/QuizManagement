<h3>Overview of Our Project</h3>

We have developed quiz management web application. This application is designed for taking quiz. It can be used in schools, colleges, universities for taking short quizzes or also for midterms. As we all know that in current situation most of the study is done online, therefore its hard for students and teachers to survive in this kind of situation. That is why we created an application where teachers can generate a quiz for students. 

Our project has the features of planning quiz questions. These questions are based on objective type therefore very detailed information need to be added. In our app an admin creates quiz test by creating questions with correct answers. The user can just enter his name and ready to take the quiz. At the end of the quiz, user can also view his result based on the questions attempted.


<h3> How to Run Our Web Application </h3>

Before running our application, it’s required to create a database named “quiz”. As we are using MySQL database for our application on localhost, so it’s required to start Apache and MySQL on XAMPP control panel before starting our application
