<h3>Overview of Our Project</h3>

We have developed quiz management web application. This application is designed for taking quiz. It can be used in schools, colleges, universities for taking short quizzes or also for midterms. As we all know that in current situation most of the study is done online, therefore its hard for students and teachers to survive in this kind of situation. That is why we created an application where teachers can generate a quiz for students. 

Our project has the features of planning quiz questions. These questions are based on objective type therefore very detailed information need to be added. In our app an admin creates quiz test by creating questions with correct answers. The user can just enter his name and ready to take the quiz. At the end of the quiz, user can also view his result based on the questions attempted.


<h3>Requirements and User Stories</h3>

Requirement can be defined as needs that are defined by clients. Its hard for a client to define all his needs, so in order to get this work done it is the job of the software project manager to help the client to clear its needs.

In the quiz management app, the client’s main need is the web app mainly for taking quizzes. All other wants of the client’s include attractive design, easy to use etc. Therefore, after analysing the needs the next step is to discuss how to fulfil those needs. For that, we need to manage the requirements. It includes business requirements, user requirements, function requirements and non-functional requirements.

Business requirements deal with the reason for the creating the webapp. On the other side user requirement deal with the working done by the user through the app. For example, in our case attempting quiz through the web app. Functional requirements described the purpose of the purpose. Such as creating quizzes. Finally, non-functional requirements include accuracy, security, and safety of the webapp.

User stories are most important technique to express requirements from the client side. It has special consistent format to define the needs.

The <b>Who</b> is in our app is the student who will attempt the quiz.

The <b>What</b> is the score that student will get after attempting.

The <b>why</b> is the reason behind this app. In our case, it is for the exams.

<h3>Estimations & Plans</h3>

Our plan was to make this app more attractive and simpler, so that both users and admin found them easy to use and manage. We discussed over the phones and online sessions to make a following plan for developing our project.

<h3>Experience</h3>	

During our project development we have learned about model view controller (mvc) architectural pattern which has become the most popular and powerful framework since it improves development process of web services and web applications.
We also have learned about unit testing, integration testing and restapi.
During our project development there had some obstacles such as poor time management because each of members had different time availability which is the most common obstacles that people overcome during a software development project. 
We had some Issues with Integration - database (mysql,jpa), view (mysql, thymeleaf).
Overall, It was quite challenging and fun to develop our application because We have learned a lot new things from this project.
